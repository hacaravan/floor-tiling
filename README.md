# Floor Tiling

## Intro

A tool to calculate how many tiles are needed to cover a given floor area, and what proportion of the tiles are wasted. This is part of a tech test i am doing for an interview.

### Running the Tool

## Brief


Design and code an application which will solve the following problem:

Given a flooring area of Length floor_length and width floor_width
and a tile/decking board of length tile_length and width tile_width,
what is the number of tiles required to cover the area.

Also return the percentage waste (comparing area of unused tiles to area of the floor) to the nearest percent.

### Input/Output Table

 Inputs | | | | Outputs | |
